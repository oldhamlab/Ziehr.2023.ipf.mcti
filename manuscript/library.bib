An important unmet need is to identify compounds and drugs that target key molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases. Over the last decade, there has been extensive interest in investigating Wingless/integrase-1 (WNT) signalling pathways; and WNT signal alterations have been linked to pulmonary disease pathogenesis and progression. Here, we comprehensively review the cumulative evidence for WNT pathway alterations in chronic lung pathologies, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, asthma and COPD. While many studies have focused on the canonical WNT/β-catenin signalling pathway, recent reports highlight that non-canonical WNT signalling may also significantly contribute to chronic lung pathologies; these studies will be particularly featured in this review. We further discuss recent advances uncovering the role of WNT signalling early in life, the potential of pharmaceutically modulating WNT signalling pathways and highlight (pre)clinical studies describing promising new therapies for chronic lung diseases.},

We report that syrosingopine, an anti-hypertensive drug, is a dual MCT1 and MCT4 inhibitor (with 60-fold higher potency on MCT4) that prevents lactate and H+ efflux. Syrosingopine elicits synthetic lethality with metformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. NAD+, required for the ATP-generating steps of glycolysis, is regenerated from NADH by mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase or lactate dehydrogenase. Syrosingopine treatment leads to high intracellular lactate levels and thereby end-product inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase. The loss of NAD+ regeneration capacity due to combined metformin and syrosingopine treatment results in glycolytic blockade, leading to ATP depletion and cell death. Accordingly, ATP levels can be partly restored by exogenously provided NAD+, the NAD precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or vitamin K2. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of MCT1 and MCT4 combined with metformin treatment is a potential cancer therapy.},

Contraction is an energy-dependent mechanism that relies on the production of ATP by mitochondria and/or glycolysis. Although the role of mitochondrial biogenesis in the adaptive responses of skeletal muscle to exercise is well appreciated, mechanisms governing energetic adaptation of myofibroblasts are not well understood. Our study demonstrates induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and aerobic glycolysis in response to the differentiation-inducing factor transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). This metabolic reprogramming is linked to the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Inhibition of p38 MAPK decreased accumulation of active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α in the nucleus and altered the translocation of mitochondrial transcription factor A to the mitochondria. Genetic or pharmacologic approaches that block mitochondrial biogenesis or glycolysis resulted in decreased contraction and reduced expression of TGF-β1-induced α-smooth muscle actin and collagen α-2(I) but not of fibronectin or collagen α-1(I). These data indicate a critical role for TGF-β1-induced metabolic reprogramming in regulating myofibroblast-specific contractile signaling and support the concept of integrating bioenergetics with cellular differentiation.},

  abstract = {Myofibroblasts participate in physiological wound healing and pathological fibrosis. Myofibroblast differentiation is characterized by the expression of α-smooth muscle actin and extracellular matrix proteins and is dependent on metabolic reprogramming. In this study, we explored the role of glutaminolysis and metabolites of TCA in supporting myofibroblast differentiation. Glutaminolysis converts Gln into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a critical intermediate in the TCA cycle. Increases in the steady-state concentrations of TCA cycle metabolites including α-KG, succinate, fumarate, malate, and citrate were observed in TGF-β1-differentiated myofibroblasts. The concentration of glutamate was also increased in TGF-β1-differentiated myofibroblasts compared with controls, whereas glutamine levels were decreased, suggesting enhanced glutaminolysis. This was associated with TGF-β1-induced expression of the glutaminase (GLS) isoform, GLS1, which converts Gln into glutamate, at both the mRNA and protein levels. The stimulation of GLS1 expression by TGF-β1 was dependent on both SMAD3 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Depletion of extracellular Gln prevented TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation. The removal of extracellular Gln postmyofibroblast differentiation decreased the expression of the profibrotic markers fibronectin and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and reversed TGF-β1-induced metabolic reprogramming. Silencing of GLS1 expression, in the presence of Gln, abrogated TGF-β1-induced expression of profibrotic markers. Treatment of GLS1-deficient myofibroblasts with exogenous glutamate or α-KG restored TGF-β1-induced expression of profibrotic markers in GLS1-deficient myofibroblasts. Together, these data demonstrate that glutaminolysis is a critical component of myofibroblast metabolic reprogramming that regulates myofibroblast differentiation.},

Levels of tenascin-C are elevated in SSc skin biopsy samples, and serum and SSc fibroblasts, and in fibrotic skin tissues from mice. Exogenous tenascin-C stimulates collagen gene expression and myofibroblast transformation via TLR4 signalling. Mice lacking tenascin-C show attenuation of skin and lung fibrosis, and accelerated fibrosis resolution. These results identify tenascin-C as an endogenous danger signal that is upregulated in SSc and drives TLR4-dependent fibroblast activation, and by its persistence impedes fibrosis resolution. Disrupting this fibrosis amplification loop might be a viable strategy for the treatment of SSc.},

  abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common human cancer and affects approximately 50,000 new patients every year in the US. The major risk factors for HNSCC are tobacco and alcohol consumption as well as oncogenic HPV infections. Despite advances in therapy, the overall survival rate for all-comers is only 50\%. Understanding the biology of HNSCC is crucial to identifying new biomarkers, implementing early diagnostic approaches and developing novel therapies. As in several other cancers, HNSCC expresses elevated levels of MCT4, a member of the SLC16 family of monocarboxylate transporters. MCT4 is a H+-linked lactate transporter which functions to facilitate lactate efflux from highly glycolytic cells. High MCT4 levels in HNSCC have been associated with poor prognosis, but the role of MCT4 in the development and progression of this cancer is still poorly understood. In this study, we used 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) to induce oral cancer in MCT4-/- and wild type littermates, recapitulating the disease progression in humans. Histological analysis of mouse tongues after 23 weeks of 4NQO treatment showed that MCT4-/- mice developed significantly fewer and less extended invasive lesions than wild type. In mice, as in human samples, MCT4 was not expressed in normal oral mucosa but was detected in the transformed epithelium. In the 4NQO treated mice we detected MCT4 in foci of the basal layer undergoing transformation, and progressively in areas of carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinomas. Moreover, we found MCT4 positive macrophages within the tumor and in the stroma surrounding the lesions in both human samples of HNSCC and in the 4NQO treated animals. The results of our studies showed that MCT4 could be used as an early diagnostic biomarker of HNSCC. Our finding with the MCT4-/- mice suggest MCT4 is a driver of progression to oral squamous cell cancer and MCT4 inhibitors could have clinical benefits for preventing invasive HNSCC.},

The lactate shuttle model suggested that lactate produced by glycolytic muscle fibers is utilized by oxidative fibers. MCT4 is a proton coupled monocarboxylate transporter preferentially expressed in glycolytic muscle fibers and facilitates the lactate efflux. Here we investigated the exercise capacity of mice with disrupted lactate shuttle due to global deletion of MCT4 (MCT4-/-) or muscle-specific deletion of the accessory protein Basigin (iMSBsg-/-). Although MCT4-/- and iMSBsg-/- mice have normal muscle morphology and contractility, only MCT4-/- mice exhibit an exercise intolerant phenotype. In~vivo measurements of compound muscle action potentials showed a decrement in the evoked response in the MCT4-/- mice. This was accompanied by a significant structural degeneration of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). We propose that disruption of the lactate shuttle impacts motor function and destabilizes the motor unit.},

QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure and report these quality requirements after data acquisition. AIM OF REVIEW: This tutorial review will guide the reader through the use of system suitability and QC samples, why these samples should be applied and how the quality of data can be reported. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: System suitability samples are applied to assess the operation and lack of contamination of the analytical platform prior to sample analysis. Isotopically-labelled internal standards are applied to assess system stability for each sample analysed. Pooled QC samples are applied to condition the analytical platform, perform intra-study reproducibility measurements (QC) and to correct~mathematically for systematic errors. Standard reference materials and long-term reference QC samples are applied for inter-study and inter-laboratory assessment of data.},

"Lactate shuttle" (LS) concepts describe the roles of lactate in delivery of oxidative and gluconeogenic substrates as well as in cell signaling. In medicine, it has long been recognized that the elevation of blood lactate correlates with illness or injury severity. However, with lactate shuttle theory in mind, some clinicians are now appreciating lactatemia as a "strain" and not a "stress" biomarker. In fact, clinical studies are utilizing lactate to treat pro-inflammatory conditions and to deliver optimal fuel for working muscles in sports medicine.

However, we found that as extracellular lactate accumulates, it also enters the mitochondrial matrix and stimulates mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity. The resulting increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis suppresses glycolysis and increases the utilization of pyruvate and/or alternative respiratory substrates. The ability of lactate to increase oxidative phosphorylation does not depend on its metabolism. Both L- and D-lactate are effective at enhancing ETC activity and suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, the selective induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by unmetabolized D-lactate reversibly suppressed aerobic glycolysis in both cancer cell lines and proliferating primary cells in an ATP-dependent manner and enabled cell growth on respiratory-dependent bioenergetic substrates. In primary T~cells, D-lactate enhanced cell proliferation and effector function. Together, these findings demonstrate that lactate is a critical regulator of the ability of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to suppress glucose fermentation.},

Culture in HPLM, relative to that in traditional media, had widespread effects on cellular metabolism, including on the metabolome, redox state, and glucose utilization. Among the most prominent was an inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis-an effect traced to uric acid, which is 10-fold higher in the blood of humans than of mice and other non-primates. We find that uric acid directly inhibits uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) and consequently reduces the sensitivity of cancer cells to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil.

  abstract = {Aging is associated with metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Aging contributes to common processes including metabolic dysfunction, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. Although glycolysis has been linked to cell growth and proliferation, the mechanisms by which the activation of glycolysis by aging regulates fibrogenesis in the lung remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine if glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-induced glycolysis regulates age-dependent fibrogenesis of the lung. Mouse and human lung tissues were analyzed for GLUT1 and glycolytic markers using immunoblotting. Glycolytic function was measured using a Seahorse apparatus. To study the effect of GLUT1, genetic inhibition of GLUT1 was performed by short hairpin RNA transduction, and phloretin was used for pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1. GLUT1-dependent glycolysis is activated in aged lung. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of GLUT1 suppressed the protein expression of α-smooth muscle actin, a key cytoskeletal component of activated fibroblasts, in mouse primary lung fibroblast cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is regulated by GLUT1-dependent glycolysis, represents a critical metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that phloretin, a potent inhibitor of GLUT1, significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in vivo. These results suggest that GLUT1-dependent glycolysis regulates fibrogenesis in aged lung and that inhibition of GLUT1 provides a potential target of therapy of age-related lung fibrosis.},

Here we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with in~vivo lineage tracing and organoid models to finely map the trajectories of alveolar-lineage cells during injury repair and lung regeneration. We identified a distinct AT2-lineage population, damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs), that arises during alveolar regeneration. We found that interstitial macrophage-derived IL-1β primes a subset of AT2 cells expressing Il1r1 for conversion into DATPs via a HIF1α-mediated glycolysis pathway, which is required for mature AT1 cell differentiation. Importantly, chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1β prevents AT1 differentiation, leading to aberrant accumulation of DATPs and impaired alveolar regeneration. Together, this stepwise mapping to cell fate transitions shows how an inflammatory niche controls alveolar regeneration by controlling stem cell fate and behavior.},

  abstract = {The neutral amino acid glutamine plays a central role in TGF-β-induced myofibroblast activation and differentiation. Cells take up glutamine mainly through a transporter expressed on the cell surface known as solute carrier SLC1A5. In this current work, we demonstrated that profibrotic actions of TGF-β are mediated, at least in part, through a metabolic maladaptation of SLC1A5 and targeting SLC1A5 abrogates multiple facets of fibroblast activation. This approach could thus represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat fibroproliferative diseases. We found that SLC1A5 was highly expressed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts and fibroblasts isolated from IPF lungs. The expression of profibrotic targets, cell migration, and anchorage independent growth by TGF-β required the activity of SLC1A5. Loss or inhibition of SLC1A5 function enhanced fibroblast susceptibility to autophagy, suppressed mTOR, HIF, Myc signaling, and impaired mitochondrial function, ATP production and glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of SLC1A5 by small molecule inhibitor V-9302 shifted fibroblast transcriptional profiles from profibrotic to fibrosis resolving, and attenuated fibrosis in a bleomycin treated mouse model of lung fibrosis. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate the utility of a pharmacological inhibitor of glutamine transport in fibrosis, laying a framework for new paradigm-shifting therapies targeting cellular metabolism for this devastating disease.},

These metabolic changes include a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation and an increased export of lactate. We identify the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and the cellular lactate exporter monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) as pivotal nodes in this metabolic axis. We observed that cardiac assist device-induced myocardial recovery in chronic HF patients was coincident with increased myocardial expression of the MPC. Moreover, the genetic ablation of the MPC in cultured cardiomyocytes and in adult murine hearts was sufficient to induce hypertrophy and HF. Conversely, MPC overexpression attenuated drug-induced hypertrophy in a cell-autonomous manner. We also introduced a novel, highly potent MCT4 inhibitor that mitigated hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes and in mice. Together, we find that alteration of the pyruvate-lactate axis is a fundamental and early feature of cardiac hypertrophy and failure.},

At these sites, extracellular lactate contributes to malignancy and immune response evasion. Intriguingly, at 30-40 mm, the reported Km of MCT4 for lactate is more than 1 order of magnitude higher than physiological or even pathological lactate levels. MCT4 is not thought to transport pyruvate. Here we have characterized cell lactate and pyruvate dynamics using the FRET sensors Laconic and Pyronic. Dominant MCT4 permeability was demonstrated in various cell types by pharmacological means and by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion. Respective Km values for lactate uptake were 1.7, 1.2, and 0.7 mm in MDA-MB-231 cells, macrophages, and HEK293 cells expressing recombinant MCT4. In MDA-MB-231 cells MCT4 exhibited a Km for pyruvate of 4.2 mm, as opposed to {$>$}150 mm reported previously. Parallel assays with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) indicated that previous Km estimates based on substrate-induced acidification were severely biased by confounding pH-regulatory mechanisms. Numerical simulation using revised kinetic parameters revealed that MCT4, but not the related transporters MCT1 and MCT2, endows cells with the ability to export lactate in high-lactate microenvironments. In conclusion, MCT4 is a high-affinity lactate transporter with physiologically relevant affinity for pyruvate.},

While the metabolic consequences of hypoxia have been studied extensively in cancer cell models, comparatively little is known about how primary cell metabolism responds to hypoxia. Thus, we developed metabolic flux models for human lung fibroblast and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferating in hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we found that hypoxia decreased glycolysis despite activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and increased glycolytic enzyme expression. While HIF-1α activation in normoxia by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition did increase glycolysis, hypoxia blocked this effect. Multi-omic profiling revealed distinct molecular responses to hypoxia and PHD inhibition, and suggested a critical role for MYC in modulating HIF-1α responses to hypoxia. Consistent with this hypothesis, MYC knockdown in hypoxia increased glycolysis and MYC over-expression in normoxia decreased glycolysis stimulated by PHD inhibition. These data suggest that MYC signaling in hypoxia uncouples an increase in HIF-dependent glycolytic gene transcription from glycolytic flux.},

In our previous systemic studies, we found that human lung myofibroblasts undergo glutaminolytic reprogramming, which is mediated by an increased expression of glutaminase (Gls) 1. We showed that augmented glutaminolysis critically regulates collagen production by promoting its stabilization in human lung myofibroblasts. Our study indicates that lung fibroblast Gls1 is a promising therapeutic target for this disease. In this investigation, we primarily focused on delineating the in vivo role of fibroblast Gls1 in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis and determining the efficacy of Gls1 inhibition in treating this pathology. We now show that fibroblast Gls1 is upregulated in fibrotic mouse lungs. We present evidence that mice with ablation of fibroblast Gls1 are protected from bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. We show that the Gls1 inhibitor, CB-839, is therapeutically efficacious in treating both bleomycin- and transforming growth factor-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our study has thus established a solid rationale for advancing Gls1 inhibitors, particularly CB-839, to the next stage of testing in the treatment of this disease.},

  abstract = {Tumors frequently display a glycolytic phenotype with increased flux through glycolysis and concomitant synthesis of lactate. To maintain glycolytic flux and prevent intracellular acidification, tumors efflux lactate via lactate transporters (MCT1-4). Inhibitors of lactate transport have the potential to inhibit glycolysis and tumor growth. We developed a small molecule inhibitor of MCT1 (AZD3965) and assessed its activity across a panel of cell lines. We explored its antitumor activity as monotherapy and in combination with doxorubicin or rituximab. AZD3965 is a potent inhibitor of MCT1 with activity against MCT2 but selectivity over MCT3 and MCT4. In vitro, AZD3965 inhibited the growth of a range of cell lines especially haematological cells. Inhibition of MCT1 by AZD3965 inhibited lactate efflux and resulted in accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. In vivo, AZD3965 caused lactate accumulation in the Raji Burkitt's lymphoma model and significant tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, AZD3965 can be combined with doxorubicin or rituximab, components of the R-CHOP standard-of-care in DLBCL and Burkitt's lymphoma. Finally, combining lactate transport inhibition by AZD3965 with GLS1 inhibition in vitro, enhanced cell growth inhibition and cell death compared to monotherapy treatment. The ability to combine AZD3965 with novel, and standard-of-care inhibitors offers novel combination opportunities in haematological cancers.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

OBJECTIVES: Develop claims algorithms to identify IPF and assess their positive predictive value (PPV) to estimate incidence and prevalence in the United States. METHODS: We developed three algorithms to identify IPF cases in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database. Sensitive and specific algorithms were developed based on literature review and consultation with clinical experts. PPVs were assessed using medical records. A third algorithm used logistic regression modeling to generate an IPF score and was validated using a separate set of medical records. We estimated incidence and prevalence of IPF using the sensitive algorithm corrected for the PPV. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 4,598 patients using the sensitive algorithm and 2,052 patients using the specific algorithm. After medical record review, the PPVs of these algorithms using the treating clinician's diagnosis were 44.4 and 61.7\%, respectively. For the IPF score, the PPV was 76.2\%. Using the clinical adjudicator's diagnosis, the PPVs were 54 and 57.6\%, respectively, and for the IPF score, the PPV was 83.3\%. The incidence and period prevalences of IPF, corrected for the PPV, were 14.6 per 100,000 person-years and 58.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sensitive algorithms without correction for false positive errors overestimated incidence and prevalence of IPF. An IPF score offered the greatest PPV, but it requires further validation.},

Molecules differing only in the number of isotopic atoms incorporated are referred to as mass isotopomers. The distribution of mass isotopomers of many molecules can be measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry after chemical derivatization. Quantification of metabolite mass isotopomer abundance resulting from biological processes necessitates correction of the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the derivatized metabolite for contributions due to naturally occurring isotopes of its elements. This correction must take into account differences in the relative natural abundance distribution of each mass isotopomer (skewing). An IBM-compatible computer program was developed which (i) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of unlabeled and labeled standards given the molecular formula of the derivatized molecule or fragment ion, and (ii) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of the singly and multiply labeled molecule or fragment via non-linear fitting to the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the unlabeled molecule or fragment. The output of this program is used to correct measured mass isotopomer distributions for contributions from natural isotope abundances and to verify measured values for theoretical consistency. Differences between predicted and measured unlabeled and 13C-labeled isotopomer distributions for hydroxamate di-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl (di-TBDMS) derivatized pyruvate were measured. The program was applied to the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose labeled from [U-13C3]glycerol and of fatty acids labeled from [U-13C6]glucose and either [2-13C2] acetate or [U-13C2]acetate. In some of these cases, the measured mass isotopomer distributions corrected by the program were different from those corrected by the classical technique. Implications of these differences including those on the calculation of glucose production due to gluconeogenesis in isolated perfused rat liver are discussed.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic diseases. Aberrantly activated myofibroblasts are the primary pathological driver of fibrotic progression, yet how various microenvironmental influences, such as hypoxia, contribute to their sustained activation and differentiation is poorly understood. As a defining feature of hypoxia is its impact on cellular metabolism, we sought to investigate how hypoxia-induced metabolic reprogramming affects myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic progression, and to test the preclinical efficacy of targeting glycolytic metabolism for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrotic progression was evaluated in two independent, fibroblast-specific, promoter-driven, hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1A knockout mouse models and in glycolytic inhibitor, dichloroacetate-treated mice. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to explicate the role of metabolic reprogramming in myofibroblast differentiation. Hypoxia significantly enhanced transforming growth factor-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation through HIF-1α, whereas overexpression of the critical HIF-1α-mediated glycolytic switch, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) was sufficient to activate glycolysis and potentiate myofibroblast differentiation, even in the absence of HIF-1α. Inhibition of the HIF-1α/PDK1 axis by genomic deletion of Hif1A or pharmacological inhibition of PDK1 significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings suggest that HIF-1α/PDK1-mediated glycolytic reprogramming is a critical metabolic alteration that acts to promote myofibroblast differentiation and fibrotic progression, and demonstrate that targeting glycolytic metabolism may prove to be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

Four (SLC16A1, SLC16A3, SLC16A7, and SLC16A8) encode monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT4, MCT2, and MCT3, respectively) catalysing the proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as l-lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies across the plasma membrane. SLC16A2 encodes a high affinity thyroid hormone transporter (MCT8) and SLC16A10 an aromatic amino acid transporter (TAT1). The substrates and roles of the remaining eight members are unknown. All family members are predicted to have 12 transmembrane helices (TMs) with intracellular C- and N-termini and a large intracellular loop between TMs 6 and 7. This topology has been confirmed for MCT1 and a three-dimensional structure has been modelled that suggests a plausible molecular mechanism. For correct plasma membrane expression and activity MCTs1-4, but not MCT8, require association with basigin or embigin; these are glycoproteins with a single TM and 2-3 extracellular immunoglobulin domains. SLC16 family members are involved in a wide range of metabolic pathways including energy metabolism of the brain, skeletal muscle, heart and tumour cells, gluconeogenesis, T-lymphocyte activation, bowel metabolism, spermatogenesis, pancreatic β-cell malfunction, thyroid hormone metabolism, and drug transport. MCTs 1-4 have distinct properties, tissue distribution and subcellular localisation that are appropriate for these metabolic roles. Their potential as pharmacological targets has been recognised with the discovery of potent and specific MCT1 inhibitors that act as immunosuppressant drugs by preventing proliferation of T-lymphocytes. It is suggested that the development of other drugs specifically targeting different MCT isoforms may provide a novel approach to cancer chemotherapy.},

We report results from the dose-escalation part of a first-in-human trial of AZD3965, a first-in-class MCT1 inhibitor, in advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicentre, phase I, dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma and no standard therapy options. Exclusion criteria included history of retinal and/or cardiac disease, due to MCT1 expression in the eye and heart. Patients received daily oral AZD3965 according to a 3+3 then rolling six design. Primary objectives were to assess safety and determine the MTD and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives for dose escalation included measurement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity. Exploratory biomarkers included tumor expression of MCT1 and MCT4, functional imaging of biological impact, and metabolomics. RESULTS: During dose escalation, 40 patients received AZD3965 at 5-30 mg once daily or 10 or 15 mg twice daily. Treatment-emergent adverse events were primarily grade 1 and/or 2, most commonly electroretinogram changes (retinopathy), fatigue, anorexia, and constipation. Seven patients receiving ≥20 mg daily experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT): grade 3 cardiac troponin rise (n = 1), asymptomatic ocular DLTs (n = 5), and grade 3 acidosis (n = 1). Plasma pharmacokinetics demonstrated attainment of target concentrations; pharmacodynamic measurements indicated on-target activity. CONCLUSIONS: AZD3965 is tolerated at doses that produce target engagement. DLTs were on-target and primarily dose-dependent, asymptomatic, reversible ocular changes. An RP2D of 10 mg twice daily was established for use in dose expansion in cancers that generally express high MCT1/low MCT4).},

  abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-dependent differentiation of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, leading to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, which distort lung architecture and function. Metabolic reprogramming in myofibroblasts is emerging as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of IPF, and recent evidence suggests that glutamine metabolism is required in myofibroblasts, although the exact role of glutamine in myofibroblasts is unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that glutamine and its conversion to glutamate by glutaminase are required for TGF-β-induced collagen protein production in lung fibroblasts. We found that metabolism of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase or the glutamate-pyruvate or glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminases is not required for collagen protein production. Instead, we discovered that the glutamate-consuming enzymes phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 18A1 (ALDH18A1)/Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) are required for collagen protein production by lung fibroblasts. PSAT1 is required for de novo glycine production, whereas ALDH18A1/P5CS is required for de novo proline production. Consistent with this, we found that TGF-β treatment increased cellular concentrations of glycine and proline in lung fibroblasts. Our results suggest that glutamine metabolism is required to promote amino acid biosynthesis and not to provide intermediates such as α-ketoglutarate for oxidation in mitochondria. In support of this, we found that inhibition of glutaminolysis has no effect on cellular oxygen consumption and that knockdown of oxoglutarate dehydrogenase has no effect on the ability of fibroblasts to produce collagen protein. Our results suggest that amino acid biosynthesis pathways may represent novel therapeutic targets for treatment of fibrotic diseases, including IPF.},

Based on the knowledge that this procedure is not standardized in animals and results are highly variable, we hypothesized that modification of this method may improve quantification of lung fibrosis in small animals. To prove our hypothesis, we evaluated pulmonary fibrosis in Lewis rats induced by a single intratracheal injection of 0.3 mg/kg body weight bleomycin (n = 13) compared with the same amount of saline in a control group (n = 4). We modified the Ashcroft scale by precisely defining the assignment of grades from 0 to 8 for the increasing extent of fibrosis in lung histological samples. Thirty-two observers were randomly assigned to evaluate 108 photographs of slides using either the Ashcroft scale or the modified scale. Consistent with our hypothesis, there was a significant reduction in the variability of standard deviations with the modified scale compared with the Ashcroft scale (mean of variability 0.25 versus 0.62, P {$<$} 0.0001). Applying the kappa index, the Ashcroft scale showed only a fair to moderate agreement (0.23-0.59) between the observers and a low intra-observer agreement (0.51-0.74) in contrast to the modified scale, which demonstrated a moderate to good agreement between the observers (0.65-0.93, P {$<$} 0.0001) and a high intra-observer agreement (0.87-0.91, P {$<$} 0.05). To test the modified scale in vivo, we compared both scales with the results of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs obtained from the same mice. In agreement, the modified scale demonstrated a better correlation to CT scans (R = 0.58) compared with the Ashcroft scale (R = 0.33). In summary, quantification of lung fibrosis in histological lung sections using the modified scale is reliable and reproducible.},

  abstract = {Mammalian tissues are fuelled by circulating nutrients, including glucose, amino acids, and various intermediary metabolites. Under aerobic conditions, glucose is generally assumed to be burned fully by tissues via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) to carbon dioxide. Alternatively, glucose can be catabolized anaerobically via glycolysis to lactate, which is itself also a potential nutrient for tissues and tumours. The quantitative relevance of circulating lactate or other metabolic intermediates as fuels remains unclear. Here we systematically examine the fluxes of circulating metabolites in mice, and find that lactate can be a primary source of carbon for the TCA cycle and thus of energy. Intravenous infusions of 13C-labelled nutrients reveal that, on a molar basis, the circulatory turnover flux of lactate is the highest of all metabolites and exceeds that of glucose by 1.1-fold in fed mice and 2.5-fold in fasting mice; lactate is made primarily from glucose but also from other sources. In both fed and fasted mice, 13C-lactate extensively labels TCA cycle intermediates in all tissues. Quantitative analysis reveals that during the fasted state, the contribution of glucose to tissue TCA metabolism is primarily indirect (via circulating lactate) in all tissues except the brain. In genetically engineered lung and pancreatic cancer tumours in fasted mice, the contribution of circulating lactate to TCA cycle intermediates exceeds that of glucose, with glutamine making a larger contribution than lactate in pancreatic cancer. Thus, glycolysis and the TCA cycle are uncoupled at the level of lactate, which is a primary circulating TCA substrate in most tissues and tumours.},

These nutrients originate from diet and internal stores, and can undergo various interconversions before their eventual use as tissue fuel. Here we develop isotope tracing, mass spectrometry, and mathematical analysis methods to determine the direct sources of circulating nutrients, their interconversion rates, and eventual tissue-specific contributions to TCA cycle metabolism. Experiments with fifteen nutrient tracers enabled extensive accounting for both circulatory metabolic cycles and tissue TCA inputs, across fed and fasted mice on either high-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. We find that a majority of circulating carbon flux is carried by two major cycles: glucose-lactate and triglyceride-glycerol-fatty acid. Futile cycling through these pathways is prominent when dietary content of the associated nutrients is low, rendering internal metabolic activity robust to food choice. The presented in~vivo flux quantification methods are broadly applicable to different physiological and disease states.},

TGF-β binds to cell-surface receptors, resulting in the phosphorylation of the Smad family of transcription factors to initiate gene expression. TGF-β also initiates Smad-independent pathways, which augment gene expression. Here, we report that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated at complex III are required for TGF-β-induced gene expression in primary normal human lung fibroblasts. TGF-β-induced ROS could be detected in both the mitochondrial matrix and cytosol. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidants markedly attenuated TGF-β-induced gene expression without affecting Smad phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Genetically disrupting mitochondrial complex III-generated ROS production attenuated TGF-β-induced profibrotic gene expression. Furthermore, inhibiting mitochondrial ROS generation attenuated NOX4 (NADPH oxidase 4) expression, which is required for TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation. Lung fibroblasts from patients with pulmonary fibrosis generated more mitochondrial ROS than normal human lung fibroblasts, and mitochondrially targeted antioxidants attenuated profibrotic gene expression in both normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Collectively, our results indicate that mitochondrial ROS are essential for normal TGF-β-mediated gene expression and that targeting mitochondrial ROS might be beneficial in diseases associated with excessive fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic and irreversible scarring disease in the lung with poor prognosis. Few therapies are available; therefore it is critical to identify new therapeutic targets. Our lab has previously identified the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDHA) as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis. We found increases in LDHA protein and its metabolic product, lactate, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Importantly, we described lactate as a novel pro-fibrotic mediator by acidifying the extracellular space, and activating latent transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) in a pH-dependent manner. We propose a pro-fibrotic feed-forward loop by which LDHA produces lactate, lactate decreases pH in the extracellular space and activates TGF-β1 which can further perpetuate fibrotic signaling. Our previous work also demonstrates that the LDHA inhibitor gossypol inhibits TGF-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production in vitro. Here, we employed a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis to test whether gossypol inhibits pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. We found that gossypol dose-dependently inhibits bleomycin-induced collagen accumulation and TGF-β1 activation in mouse lungs when treatment is started on the same day as bleomycin administration. Importantly, gossypol was also effective at treating collagen accumulation when delayed 7 days following bleomycin. Our results demonstrate that inhibition of LDHA with the inhibitor gossypol is effective at both preventing and treating bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and suggests that LDHA may be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract = {Cancer cells adapt their metabolic processes to support rapid proliferation, but less is known about how cancer cells alter metabolism to promote cell survival in a poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment. Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In two of three phase 3 trials, pirfenidone, an oral antifibrotic therapy, reduced disease progression, as measured by the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) or vital capacity, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; in the third trial, this end point was not achieved. We sought to confirm the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on disease progression in such patients. METHODS: In this phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 555 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis to receive either oral pirfenidone (2403 mg per day) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was the change in FVC or death at week 52. Secondary end points were the 6-minute walk distance, progression-free survival, dyspnea, and death from any cause or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS: In the pirfenidone group, as compared with the placebo group, there was a relative reduction of 47.9\% in the proportion of patients who had an absolute decline of 10 percentage points or more in the percentage of the predicted FVC or who died; there was also a relative increase of 132.5\% in the proportion of patients with no decline in FVC (P{$<$}0.001). Pirfenidone reduced the decline in the 6-minute walk distance (P=0.04) and improved progression-free survival (P{$<$}0.001). There was no significant between-group difference in dyspnea scores (P=0.16) or in rates of death from any cause (P=0.10) or from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P=0.23). However, in a prespecified pooled analysis incorporating results from two previous phase 3 trials, the between-group difference favoring pirfenidone was significant for death from any cause (P=0.01) and from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P=0.006). Gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events were more common in the pirfenidone group than in the placebo group but rarely led to treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone, as compared with placebo, reduced disease progression, as reflected by lung function, exercise tolerance, and progression-free survival, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment was associated with an acceptable side-effect profile and fewer deaths. (Funded by InterMune; ASCEND ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01366209.).},

  abstract = {Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is an ubiquitously used tool for evaluating pathway enrichment in transcriptional data. Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. FGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a complex disease for which the pathogenesis is poorly understood. In this study, we identified lactic acid as a metabolite that is elevated in the lung tissue of patients with IPF. OBJECTIVES: This study examines the effect of lactic acid on myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We used metabolomic analysis to examine cellular metabolism in lung tissue from patients with IPF and determined the effects of lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase-5 (LDH5) overexpression on myofibroblast differentiation and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β activation in vitro. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lactic acid concentrations from healthy and IPF lung tissue were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; α-smooth muscle actin, calponin, and LDH5 expression were assessed by Western blot of cell culture lysates. Lactic acid and LDH5 were significantly elevated in IPF lung tissue compared with controls. Physiologic concentrations of lactic acid induced myofibroblast differentiation via activation of TGF-β. TGF-β induced expression of LDH5 via hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). Importantly, overexpression of both HIF1α and LDH5 in human lung fibroblasts induced myofibroblast differentiation and synergized with low-dose TGF-β to induce differentiation. Furthermore, inhibition of both HIF1α and LDH5 inhibited TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the metabolite lactic acid as an important mediator of myofibroblast differentiation via a pH-dependent activation of TGF-β. We propose that the metabolic milieu of the lung, and potentially other tissues, is an important driving force behind myofibroblast differentiation and potentially the initiation and progression of fibrotic disorders.},

  abstract = {Myofibroblasts are one of the primary cell types responsible for the accumulation of extracellular matrix in fibrosing diseases, and targeting myofibroblast differentiation is an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been shown to be an important inducer of myofibroblast differentiation. We previously demonstrated that lactate dehydrogenase and its metabolic product lactic acid are important mediators of myofibroblast differentiation, via acid-induced activation of latent TGF-β. Here we explore whether pharmacologic inhibition of LDH activity can prevent TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Primary human lung fibroblasts from healthy patients and those with pulmonary fibrosis were treated with TGF-β and or gossypol, an LDH inhibitor. Protein and RNA were analyzed for markers of myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix generation. Gossypol inhibited TGF-β-induced expression of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in a dose-dependent manner in both healthy and fibrotic human lung fibroblasts. Gossypol also inhibited expression of collagen 1, collagen 3, and fibronectin. Gossypol inhibited LDH activity, the generation of extracellular lactic acid, and the rate of extracellular acidification in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, gossypol inhibited TGF-β bioactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrent treatment with an LDH siRNA increased the ability of gossypol to inhibit TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Gossypol inhibits TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation through inhibition of LDH, inhibition of extracellular accumulation of lactic acid, and inhibition of TGF-β bioactivity. These data support the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of LDH may play an important role in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.},

In LH samples, pirfenidone treatment was mostly associated with inflammation-related processes. In FB and LH, regulated genes were over-represented in the Gene Ontology node "extracellular matrix". We identified lower expression of cell migration-inducing and hyaluronan-binding protein (CEMIP) in both LH and FB from pirfenidone-treated IPF patients. Plasma levels of CEMIP were elevated in IPF patients compared to healthy controls and decreased after 7\>months of pirfenidone treatment. CEMIP expression in FB was downregulated in a glioma-associated oncogene homologue-dependent manner and CEMIP silencing in IPF FB reduced collagen production and attenuated cell proliferation and migration.Cumulatively, our approach indicates that pirfenidone exerts beneficial effects via its action on multiple pathways in both FB and other pulmonary cells, through its ability to control extracellular matrix architecture and inflammatory reactions.},

  abstract = {Lactate is abundant in rapidly dividing cells due to the requirement for elevated glucose catabolism to support proliferation1-6. However, it is not known whether accumulated lactate affects the proliferative state. Here, we deploy a systematic approach to determine lactate-dependent regulation of proteins across the human proteome. From these data, we elucidate a mechanism of cell cycle regulation whereby accumulated lactate remodels the anaphase promoting complex (APC/C). Remodeling of APC/C in this way is caused by direct inhibition of the SUMO protease SENP1 by lactate. We discover that accumulated lactate binds and inhibits SENP1 by forming a complex with zinc in the SENP1 active site. SENP1 inhibition by lactate stabilizes SUMOylation of two residues on APC4, which drives UBE2C binding to APC/C. This direct regulation of APC/C by lactate stimulates timed degradation of cell cycle proteins, and efficient mitotic exit in proliferative human cells. The above mechanism is initiated upon mitotic entry when lactate abundance reaches its apex. In this way, accumulation of lactate communicates the consequences of a nutrient replete growth phase to stimulate timed opening of APC/C, cell division, and proliferation. Conversely, persistent accumulation of lactate drives aberrant APC/C remodeling and can overcome anti-mitotic pharmacology via mitotic slippage. Taken together, we define a biochemical mechanism through which lactate directly regulates protein function to control cell cycle and proliferation.},

Here, we show LA binds to soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in normal hepatocytes and affects systemic iron homeostasis in mice by increasing hepcidin expression. Comprehensive in~vitro, in~vivo, and in silico experiments show that the LA-sAC interaction raises cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which activates the PKA-Smad1/5/8 signaling pathway to increase hepcidin transcription. We verified this regulatory axis in wild-type mice and in mice with disordered iron homeostasis. LA also regulates hepcidin in humans at rest and subjected to extensive exercise that produce elevated LA. Our study links hyperlactatemia to iron deficiency, offering a mechanistic explanation for anemias seen in athletes and patients with lactic acidosis.},

Tyrosine oxidation is also required for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormone in vertebrates, and there is evidence for oxidative cross-linking reactions occurring in extracellular proteins secreted by myofibroblasts. The ECM protein fibronectin circulates in the blood as a globular protein that dimerizes through disulfide bridges generated by cysteine oxidation. We found that cellular (fibrillar) fibronectin on the surface of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-activated human myofibroblasts underwent multimerization by o,o'-dityrosine cross-linking under reducing conditions that disrupt disulfide bridges, but soluble fibronectin did not. This reaction on tyrosine residues required both the TGF-β1-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide and the presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) derived from inflammatory cells, which are active participants in wound healing and fibrogenic processes. Oxidative cross-linking of matrix fibronectin attenuated both epithelial and fibroblast migration and conferred resistance to proteolysis by multiple proteases. The abundance of circulating o,o'-dityrosine-modified fibronectin was increased in a murine model of lung fibrosis and in human subjects with interstitial lung disease compared to that in control healthy subjects. These studies indicate that tyrosine can undergo stable, covalent linkages in fibrillar fibronectin under inflammatory conditions and that this modification affects the migratory behavior of cells on such modified matrices, suggesting that this modification may play a role in both physiologic and pathophysiologic tissue repair.},

It is associated with increasing cough and dyspnoea and impaired quality of life. IPF affects ∼3 million people worldwide, with incidence increasing dramatically with age. The diagnostic approach includes the exclusion of other interstitial lung diseases or overlapping conditions and depends on the identification of the UIP pattern, usually with high-resolution CT; lung biopsy might be required in some patients. The UIP pattern is predominantly bilateral, peripheral and with a basal distribution of reticular changes associated with traction bronchiectasis and clusters of subpleural cystic airspaces. The biological processes underlying IPF are thought to reflect an aberrant reparative response to repetitive alveolar epithelial injury in a genetically susceptible ageing individual, although many questions remain on how to define susceptibility. Substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the clinical management of IPF, with the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic agents, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that decrease physiological progression and likely improve progression-free survival. Current efforts are directed at identifying IPF early, potentially relying on combinations of biomarkers that include circulating factors, demographics and imaging data.},

  abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive vascular disease with a high mortality rate. It is characterized by an occlusive vascular remodeling due to a pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic environment in the wall of resistance pulmonary arteries (PAs). Proliferating cells exhibit a cancer-like metabolic switch where mitochondrial glucose oxidation is suppressed, whereas glycolysis is up-regulated as the major source of adenosine triphosphate production. This multifactorial mitochondrial suppression leads to inhibition of apoptosis and downstream signaling promoting proliferation. We report an increase in pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH, the gatekeeping enzyme of glucose oxidation) in the PAs of human PAH compared to healthy lungs. Treatment of explanted human PAH lungs with the PDK inhibitor dichloroacetate (DCA) ex vivo activated PDH and increased mitochondrial respiration. In a 4-month, open-label study, DCA (3 to 6.25 mg/kg b.i.d.) administered to patients with idiopathic PAH (iPAH) already on approved iPAH therapies led to reduction in mean PA pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance and improvement in functional capacity, but with a range of individual responses. Lack of ex vivo and clinical response was associated with the presence of functional variants of SIRT3 and UCP2 that predict reduced protein function. Impaired function of these proteins causes PDK-independent mitochondrial suppression and pulmonary hypertension in mice. This first-in-human trial of a mitochondria-targeting drug in iPAH demonstrates that PDK is a druggable target and offers hemodynamic improvement in genetically susceptible patients, paving the way for novel precision medicine approaches in this disease.},

  abstract = {Partitioning of ATP generation between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is central to cellular bioenergetics but cumbersome to measure. We describe here how rates of ATP generation by each pathway can be calculated from simultaneous measurements of extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. We update theoretical maximum ATP yields by mitochondria and cells catabolizing different substrates. Mitochondrial P/O ratios (mol of ATP generated per mol of [O] consumed) are 2.73 for oxidation of pyruvate plus malate and 1.64 for oxidation of succinate. Complete oxidation of glucose by cells yields up to 33.45 ATP/glucose with a maximum P/O of 2.79. We introduce novel indices to quantify bioenergetic phenotypes. The glycolytic index reports the proportion of ATP production from glycolysis and identifies cells as primarily glycolytic (glycolytic index {$>$} 50\%) or primarily oxidative. The Warburg effect is a chronic increase in glycolytic index, quantified by the Warburg index. Additional indices quantify the acute flexibility of ATP supply. The Crabtree index and Pasteur index quantify the responses of oxidative and glycolytic ATP production to alterations in glycolysis and oxidative reactions, respectively; the supply flexibility index quantifies overall flexibility of ATP supply; and the bioenergetic capacity quantifies the maximum rate of total ATP production. We illustrate the determination of these indices using C2C12 myoblasts. Measurement of ATP use revealed no significant preference for glycolytic or oxidative ATP by specific ATP consumers. Overall, we demonstrate how extracellular fluxes quantitatively reflect intracellular ATP turnover and cellular bioenergetics. We provide a simple spreadsheet to calculate glycolytic and oxidative ATP production rates from raw extracellular acidification and respiration data.},

Here, we have identified L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L2HG) as a universal adaptive determinant of the hypoxia response. L2HG is a metabolite of unknown function produced by the reduction of mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate by malate dehydrogenase. L2HG accumulates in response to increases in 2-oxoglutarate, which occur as a result of tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction and increased mitochondrial reducing potential. These changes are closely coupled to cellular redox homeostasis, as increased cellular L2HG inhibits electron transport and glycolysis to offset the adverse consequences of mitochondrial reductive stress induced by hypoxia. Thus, L2HG couples mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy metabolism in a model of cellular redox regulation.},

Inhibitor titrations of L-lactate transport by MCT1 in rat erythrocytes were used to determine the Ki value and number of AR-C155858-binding sites (Et) on MCT1 and the turnover number of the transporter (kcat). Derived values were 2.3+/-1.4 nM, 1.29+/-0.09 nmol per ml of packed cells and 12.2+/-1.1 s-1 respectively. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, MCT1 and MCT2 were potently inhibited by AR-C155858, whereas MCT4 was not. Inhibition of MCT1 was shown to be time-dependent, and the compound was also active when microinjected, suggesting that AR-C155858 probably enters the cell before binding to an intracellular site on MCT1. Measurement of the inhibitor sensitivity of several chimaeric transporters combining different domains of MCT1 and MCT4 revealed that the binding site for AR-C155858 is contained within the C-terminal half of MCT1, and involves TM (transmembrane) domains 7-10. This is consistent with previous data identifying Phe360 (in TM10) and Asp302 plus Arg306 (TM8) as key residues in substrate binding and translocation by MCT1. Measurement of the Km values of the chimaeras for L-lactate and pyruvate demonstrate that both the C- and N-terminal halves of the molecule influence transport kinetics consistent with our proposed molecular model of MCT1 and its translocation mechanism that requires Lys38 in TM1 in addition to Asp302 and Arg306 in TM8 [Wilson, Meredith, Bunnun, Sessions and Halestrap (2009) J.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumors are highly plastic metabolic entities composed of cancer and host cells that can adopt different metabolic phenotypes. For energy production, cancer cells may use 4 main fuels that are shuttled in 5 different metabolic pathways. Glucose fuels glycolysis that can be coupled to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in oxidative cancer cells or to lactic fermentation in proliferating and in hypoxic cancer cells. Lipids fuel lipolysis, glutamine fuels glutaminolysis, and lactate fuels the oxidative pathway of lactate, all of which are coupled to the TCA cycle and OXPHOS for energy production. This review focuses on the latter metabolic pathway. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Lactate, which is prominently produced by glycolytic cells in tumors, was only recently recognized as a major fuel for oxidative cancer cells and as a signaling agent. Its exchanges across membranes are gated by monocarboxylate transporters MCT1-4. This review summarizes the current knowledge about MCT structure, regulation and functions in cancer, with a specific focus on lactate metabolism, lactate-induced angiogenesis and MCT-dependent cancer metastasis. It also describes lactate signaling via cell surface lactate receptor GPR81. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Lactate and MCTs, especially MCT1 and MCT4, are important contributors to tumor aggressiveness. Analyses of MCT-deficient (MCT+/- and MCT-/-) animals and (MCT-mutated) humans indicate that they are druggable, with MCT1 inhibitors being in advanced development phase and MCT4 inhibitors still in the discovery phase. Imaging lactate fluxes non-invasively using a lactate tracer for positron emission tomography would further help to identify responders to the treatments.},

  abstract = {Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis and use this metabolic pathway for generation of ATP as a main source of their energy supply. This phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect and is considered as one of the most fundamental metabolic alterations during malignant transformation. In recent years, there are significant progresses in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the potential therapeutic implications. Biochemical and molecular studies suggest several possible mechanisms by which this metabolic alteration may evolve during cancer development. These mechanisms include mitochondrial defects and malfunction, adaptation to hypoxic tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling, and abnormal expression of metabolic enzymes. Importantly, the increased dependence of cancer cells on glycolytic pathway for ATP generation provides a biochemical basis for the design of therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill cancer cells by pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis. Several small molecules have emerged that exhibit promising anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, as single agent or in combination with other therapeutic modalities. The glycolytic inhibitors are particularly effective against cancer cells with mitochondrial defects or under hypoxic conditions, which are frequently associated with cellular resistance to conventional anticancer drugs and radiation therapy. Because increased aerobic glycolysis is commonly seen in a wide spectrum of human cancers and hypoxia is present in most tumor microenvironment, development of novel glycolytic inhibitors as a new class of anticancer agents is likely to have broad therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major causes leading to failure of cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) MCT1 and MCT4, which are overexpressed in solid tumours, play a very important role in cancer cell survival and proliferation. These lactate transporters work complimentarily to drive lactate shuttle in tumour cells, which results in maintenance of H+ ion (pH) balance necessary for their survival. Inhibition of these transmembrane proteins has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to treat drug resistant solid cancers. Presently, only a few small molecule MCT1 inhibitors such as AZD3965 and AR-C155858 are known with clinical potential. Even lesser mention of MCT4 inhibitors, which include molecules having scaffolds such as pyrazole and indazole, is available in the literature. Current overview presents the status of recent developments undertaken in identification of efficacious MCT1 and/or MCT4 inhibitors as a potential anticancer therapy overcoming MDR. Further, detailed structure-activity relationships for different classes of compounds has been proposed to streamline the understandings learnt from ongoing research work. Through this review, we aim to highlight the importance of these excellent targets and facilitate future development of selective, potent and safe MCT1 and/or MCT4 inhibitors as promising chemotherapy for drug resistant cancer.},

The precise antifibrotic mechanism(s) of action of nintedanib, however, is not known. Therefore, we studied the effects of nintedanib on fibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with IPF. Protein and gene expression of profibrotic markers were assessed by Western immunoblotting and real-time PCR. Autophagy markers and signaling events were monitored by biochemical assays, Western immunoblotting, microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining. Silencing of autophagy effector proteins was achieved with small interfering RNAs. Nintedanib down-regulated protein and mRNA expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, fibronectin, and collagen 1a1 while inhibiting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced myofibroblast differentiation. Nintedanib also induced beclin-1-dependent, ATG7-independent autophagy. Nintedanib's ECM-suppressive actions were not mediated by canonical autophagy. Nintedanib inhibited early events in TGF-β signaling, specifically tyrosine phosphorylation of the type II TGF-β receptor, activation of SMAD3, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Nintedanib down-regulates ECM production and induces noncanonical autophagy in IPF fibroblasts while inhibiting TGF-β signaling. These mechanisms appear to be uncoupled and function independently to mediate its putative antifibrotic effects.},

Cellular metabolism regulates tissue repair and remodelling responses to injury2-4. AMPK is a critical sensor of cellular bioenergetics and controls the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism5. However, the role of AMPK in fibrosis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that in humans with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and in an experimental mouse model of lung fibrosis, AMPK activity is lower in fibrotic regions associated with metabolically active and apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. Pharmacological activation of AMPK in myofibroblasts from lungs of humans with IPF display lower fibrotic activity, along with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and normalization of sensitivity to apoptosis. In a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis in mice, metformin therapeutically accelerates the resolution of well-established fibrosis in an AMPK-dependent manner. These studies implicate deficient AMPK activation in non-resolving, pathologic fibrotic processes, and support a role for metformin (or other AMPK activators) to reverse established fibrosis by facilitating deactivation and apoptosis of myofibroblasts.},

To evaluate the contributions of age and sex to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, we intratracheally instilled young (8-12 wk) and aged (52-54 wk) male and female mice with bleomycin and assessed the development and severity of fibrotic lung disease by measurements of lung collagen levels, static compliance, leukocyte infiltration, and stereological quantification of fibrotic areas in histological sections. We also quantified proinflammatory and profibrotic chemokine and cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Aged male mice developed more severe lung disease, indicated by increased mortality, increased collagen deposition, and neutrophilic alveolitis compared with aged female mice or young mice of either sex. Aged male mice also exhibited increased levels of transforming growth factor-β, IL-17A, and CXCL1 in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Young male mice developed a more fibrotic disease after bleomycin instillation compared with female mice, regardless of age. There was no difference in fibrosis between young and aged female mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that the variables of advanced age and male sex contribute to the severity of pulmonary fibrosis in this model.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nintedanib (formerly known as BIBF 1120) is an intracellular inhibitor that targets multiple tyrosine kinases. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The primary end point was the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC). Key secondary end points were the time to the first acute exacerbation and the change from baseline in the total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, both assessed over a 52-week period. RESULTS: A total of 1066 patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to receive nintedanib or placebo. The adjusted annual rate of change in FVC was -114.7 ml with nintedanib versus -239.9 ml with placebo (difference, 125.3 ml; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 77.7 to 172.8; P{$<$}0.001) in INPULSIS-1 and -113.6 ml with nintedanib versus -207.3 ml with placebo (difference, 93.7 ml; 95\% CI, 44.8 to 142.7; P{$<$}0.001) in INPULSIS-2. In INPULSIS-1, there was no significant difference between the nintedanib and placebo groups in the time to the first acute exacerbation (hazard ratio with nintedanib, 1.15; 95\% CI, 0.54 to 2.42; P=0.67); in INPULSIS-2, there was a significant benefit with nintedanib versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.77; P=0.005). The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5\% and 18.6\% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2\% and 18.3\% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5\% of patients.

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal respiratory disease characterized by aberrant fibroblast activation and progressive fibrotic remodelling of the lungs. Though the exact pathophysiological mechanisms of IPF remain unknown, TGF-β1 is thought to act as a main driver of the disease by mediating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT). Recent reports have indicated that a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis takes place during FMT and that metabolic shifts can directly influence aberrant cell function. This has led to the hypothesis that inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5), an enzyme responsible for converting pyruvate into lactate, could constitute a therapeutic concept for IPF. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the potential link between aerobic glycolysis and FMT using a potent LDH5 inhibitor (Compound 408, Genentech). Seahorse analysis was performed to determine the effect of Compound 408 on TGF-β1-driven glycolysis in WI-38 fibroblasts. TGF-β1-mediated FMT was measured by quantifying α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin in primary human lung fibroblasts following treatment with Compound 408. Lactate and pyruvate levels in the cell culture supernatant were assessed by LC-MS/MS. In addition to pharmacological LDH5 inhibition, the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of LDHA and LDHB on FMT was examined. RESULTS: We show that treatment of lung fibroblasts with Compound 408 efficiently inhibits LDH5 and attenuates the TGF-β1-mediated metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. Additionally, we demonstrate that LDH5 inhibition has no significant effect on TGF-β1-mediated FMT in primary human lung fibroblasts by analysing α-SMA fibre formation and fibronectin expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data strongly suggest that while LDH5 inhibition can prevent metabolic shifts in fibroblasts, it has no influence on FMT and therefore glycolytic dysregulation is unlikely to be the sole driver of FMT.},

  abstract = {The production and secretion of matrix proteins upon stimulation of fibroblasts by transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) play a critical role in wound healing. How TGFβ supports the bioenergetic cost of matrix protein synthesis is not fully understood. Here, we show that TGFβ promotes protein translation at least in part by increasing the mitochondrial oxidation of glucose and glutamine carbons to support the bioenergetic demand of translation. Surprisingly, we found that in addition to stimulating the entry of glucose and glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle, TGFβ induced the biosynthesis of proline from glutamine in a Smad4-dependent fashion. Metabolic manipulations that increased mitochondrial redox generation promoted proline biosynthesis, while reducing mitochondrial redox potential and/or ATP synthesis impaired proline biosynthesis. Thus, proline biosynthesis acts as a redox vent, preventing the TGFβ-induced increase in mitochondrial glucose and glutamine catabolism from generating damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) when TCA cycle activity exceeds the ability of oxidative phosphorylation to convert mitochondrial redox potential into ATP. In turn, the enhanced synthesis of proline supports TGFβ-induced production of matrix proteins.},

  abstract = {The differentiation of fibroblasts into a transient population of highly activated, extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myofibroblasts at sites of tissue injury is critical for normal tissue repair. Excessive myofibroblast accumulation and persistence, often as a result of a failure to undergo apoptosis when tissue repair is complete, lead to pathological fibrosis and are also features of the stromal response in cancer. Myofibroblast differentiation is accompanied by changes in cellular metabolism, including increased glycolysis, to meet the biosynthetic demands of enhanced ECM production. Here, we showed that transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), the key pro-fibrotic cytokine implicated in multiple fibrotic conditions, increased the production of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the transcriptional master regulator of amino acid metabolism, to supply glucose-derived glycine to meet the amino acid requirements associated with enhanced collagen production in response to myofibroblast differentiation. We further delineated the signaling pathways involved and showed that TGF-β1-induced ATF4 production depended on cooperation between canonical TGF-β1 signaling through Smad3 and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its downstream target eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). ATF4, in turn, promoted the transcription of genes encoding enzymes of the de novo serine-glycine biosynthetic pathway and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Our findings suggest that targeting the TGF-β1-mTORC1-ATF4 axis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for interfering with myofibroblast function in fibrosis and potentially in other conditions, including cancer.},

Despite the growing incidence of fibrotic diseases and extensive research efforts, there remains a lack of effective therapies that improve survival. The application of omics technologies has revolutionized our approach to identifying previously unknown therapeutic targets and potential disease biomarkers. The application of metabolomics, in particular, has improved our understanding of disease pathomechanisms and garnered a wave of scientific interest in the role of metabolism in the biology of myofibroblasts, the key effector cells of the fibrogenic response. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in metabolism not only are a feature of but also may play an influential role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis, most notably in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most rapidly progressive and fatal of all fibrotic conditions. This review will detail the role of key metabolic pathways, their alterations in myofibroblasts, and the potential this new knowledge offers for the development of antifibrotic therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry with stable isotope labels has been seminal in discovering the dynamic state of living matter, but is limited to bulk tissues or cells. We developed multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) that allowed us to view and measure stable isotope incorporation with submicrometre resolution. Here we apply MIMS to diverse organisms, including Drosophila, mice and humans. We test the 'immortal strand hypothesis', which predicts that during asymmetric stem cell division chromosomes containing older template DNA are segregated to the daughter destined to remain a stem cell, thus insuring lifetime genetic stability. After labelling mice with (15)N-thymidine from gestation until post-natal week 8, we find no (15)N label retention by dividing small intestinal crypt cells after a four-week chase. In adult mice administered (15)N-thymidine pulse-chase, we find that proliferating crypt cells dilute the (15)N label, consistent with random strand segregation. We demonstrate the broad utility of MIMS with proof-of-principle studies of lipid turnover in Drosophila and translation to the human haematopoietic system. These studies show that MIMS provides high-resolution quantification of stable isotope labels that cannot be obtained using other techniques and that is broadly applicable to biological and medical research.},

We show that lysophosphatidic acid levels increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following lung injury in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, and that mice lacking one of its receptors, LPA1, are markedly protected from fibrosis and mortality in this model. The absence of LPA1 led to reduced fibroblast recruitment and vascular leak, two responses that may be excessive when injury leads to fibrosis rather than to repair, whereas leukocyte recruitment was preserved during the first week after injury. In persons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lysophosphatidic acid levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also increased, and inhibition of LPA1 markedly reduced fibroblast responses to the chemotactic activity of this fluid. LPA1 therefore represents a new therapeutic target for diseases in which aberrant responses to injury contribute to fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

This study aimed to determine the utility of circulating MMPs and TIMPs in distinguishing patients with IPF from controls and to explore associations between MMPs/TIMPs and measures of disease severity in patients with IPF. METHODS: The IPF cohort (n\,=\,300) came from the IPF-PRO Registry, an observational multicenter registry of patients with IPF that was diagnosed or confirmed at the enrolling center in the past 6\,months. Controls (n\,=\,100) without known lung disease came from a population-based registry. Generalized linear models were used to compare circulating concentrations of MMPs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, and 13 and TIMPs 1, 2, and 4 between patients with IPF and controls, and to investigate associations between circulating levels of these proteins and measures of IPF severity. Multivariable models were fit to identify the MMP/TIMPs that best distinguished patients with IPF from controls. RESULTS: All the MMP/TIMPs analyzed were present at significantly higher levels in patients with IPF compared with controls except for TIMP2. Multivariable analyses selected MMP8, MMP9 and TIMP1 as top candidates for distinguishing patients with IPF from controls. Higher concentrations of MMP7, MMP12, MMP13 and TIMP4 were significantly associated with lower diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) \% predicted and higher composite physiologic index (worse disease). MMP9 was associated with the composite physiologic index. No MMP/TIMPs were associated with forced vital capacity \% predicted. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating MMPs and TIMPs were broadly elevated among patients with IPF. Select MMP/TIMPs strongly associated with measures of disease severity. Our results identify potential MMP/TIMP targets for further development as disease-related biomarkers.},

Here, using droplet- and plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing of approximately 75,000 human cells across all lung tissue compartments and circulating blood, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, we create an extensive cell atlas of the human lung. We define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 out of 45 previously known cell types and 14 previously unknown ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas identifies the biochemical functions of lung cells and the transcription factors and markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signalling interactions and immune cell homing; and identifies cell types that are directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory viruses. By comparing human and mouse data, we identified 17 molecular cell types that have been gained or lost during lung evolution and others with substantially altered expression profiles, revealing extensive plasticity of cell types and cell-type-specific gene expression during organ evolution including expression switches between cell types. This atlas provides the molecular foundation for investigating how lung cell identities, functions and interactions are achieved in development and tissue engineering and altered in disease and evolution.},

  abstract = {The monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 mediates lactic acid efflux from most tissues that are dependent on glycolysis for their ATP production. Here we demonstrate that expression of MCT4 mRNA and protein was increased {$>$}3-fold by a 48-h exposure to 1\% O(2), whereas MCT1 expression was not increased. The effect was mimicked by CoCl(2) (50 microm), suggesting transcriptional regulation by hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha). The predicted promoters for human MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 were cloned into the pGL3 vector and shown to be active (luciferase luminescence) under basal conditions. Only the MCT4 promoter was activated ({$>$}2-fold) by hypoxia. No response was found in cells lacking HIF-1alpha. Four potential hypoxia-response elements were identified, but deletion analysis implicated only two in the hypoxia response. These were just upstream from the transcription start site and also found in the mouse MCT4 promoter. Mutation of site 2 totally abolished the hypoxic response, whereas mutation of site 1 only reduced the response. Gel-shift analysis demonstrated that nuclear extracts of hypoxic but not normoxic HeLa cells contained two transcription factors that bound to DNA probes containing these hypoxia-response elements. The major shifted band was abolished by mutation of site 2, and supershift analysis confirmed that HIF-1alpha bound to this site. Binding of the second factor was abolished by mutation of site 1. We conclude that MCT4, like other glycolytic enzymes, is up-regulated by hypoxia through a HIF-1alpha-mediated mechanism. This adaptive response allows the increased lactic acid produced during hypoxia to be rapidly lost from the cell.},

Most commonly used pulmonary function variables of humans are not routinely applied in mice, and the question of which pulmonary function is optimal for the monitoring of a particular disease model remains largely unanswered. Our study aimed to delineate the potential and restrictions of existing pulmonary function techniques in different respiratory disease models, and to determine some common variables between humans and mice. A noninvasive (unrestrained plethysmography) and two invasive pulmonary function devices (forced maneuvers system from Buxco Research Systems [Wilmington, NC] and forced oscillation technique from SCIREQ [Montreal, PQ, Canada]) were evaluated in well-established models of asthma (protein and chemical induced): a model of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema, and a model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast to noninvasive tests, both invasive techniques were efficacious for the quantification of parenchymal disease via changes in functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, vital capacity, and compliance of the respiratory system. Airflow obstruction and airflow limitation at baseline were only present in emphysema, but could be significantly induced after methacholine challenge in mice with asthma, which correlated best with an increase of respiratory resistance. Invasive pulmonary functions allow distinction between respiratory diseases in mice by clinically relevant variables, and should become standard in the functional evaluation of pathological disease models.},

  abstract = {In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), inflammation promotes a fibroproliferative pulmonary vasculopathy. Reductionist studies emphasizing single biochemical reactions suggest a shift toward glycolytic metabolism in PAH; however, key questions remain regarding the metabolic profile of specific cell types within PAH vascular lesions in vivo. We used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) freshly isolated from an inflammatory vascular injury model of PAH ex vivo, and these data were integrated with information from human gene ontology pathways. Network medicine was then used to map all aa and glucose pathways to the consolidated human interactome, which includes data on 233,957 physical protein-protein interactions. Glucose and proline pathways were significantly close to the human PAH disease module, suggesting that these pathways are functionally relevant to PAH pathobiology. To test this observation in vivo, we used multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry to map and quantify utilization of glucose and proline in the PAH pulmonary vasculature at subcellular resolution. Our findings suggest that elevated glucose and proline avidity underlie increased biomass in PAECs and the media of fibrosed PAH pulmonary arterioles. Overall, these data show that anabolic utilization of glucose and proline are fundamental to the vascular pathology of PAH.},

  abstract = {Fibrotic diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality, yet there are few effective therapies. The underlying pathology of all fibrotic conditions is the activity of myofibroblasts. Using cells from freshly excised disease tissue from patients with Dupuytren's disease (DD), a localized fibrotic disorder of the palm, we sought to identify new therapeutic targets for fibrotic disease. We hypothesized that the persistent activity of myofibroblasts in fibrotic diseases might involve epigenetic modifications. Using a validated genetics-led target prioritization algorithm (Pi) of genome wide association studies (GWAS) data and a broad screen of epigenetic inhibitors, we found that the acetyltransferase CREBBP/EP300 is a major regulator of contractility and extracellular matrix production via control of H3K27 acetylation at the profibrotic genes, ACTA2 and COL1A1 Genomic analysis revealed that EP300 is highly enriched at enhancers associated with genes involved in multiple profibrotic pathways, and broad transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of CREBBP/EP300 inhibition by the chemical probe SGC-CBP30 identified collagen VI (Col VI) as a prominent downstream regulator of myofibroblast activity. Targeted Col VI knockdown results in significant decrease in profibrotic functions, including myofibroblast contractile force, extracellular matrix (ECM) production, chemotaxis, and wound healing. Further evidence for Col VI as a major determinant of fibrosis is its abundant expression within Dupuytren's nodules and also in the fibrotic foci of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Thus, Col VI may represent a tractable therapeutic target across a range of fibrotic disorders.},

  abstract = {The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To explore its mode of action, nintedanib was tested in human lung fibroblasts and mouse models of lung fibrosis. Human lung fibroblasts expressing platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-α and -β were stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor BB (homodimer) (PDGF-BB). Receptor activation was assessed by autophosphorylation and cell proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation was determined by α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) mRNA analysis. Lung fibrosis was induced in mice by intratracheal bleomycin or silica particle administration. Nintedanib was administered every day by gavage at 30, 60, or 100 mg/kg. Preventive nintedanib treatment regimen started on the day that bleomycin was administered. Therapeutic treatment regimen started at various times after the induction of lung fibrosis. Bleomycin caused increased macrophages and lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and elevated interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and collagen in lung tissue. Histology revealed chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Silica-induced lung pathology additionally showed elevated BAL neutrophils, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) levels, and granuloma formation. Nintedanib inhibited PDGF receptor activation, fibroblast proliferation, and fibroblast to myofibroblast transformation. Nintedanib significantly reduced BAL lymphocytes and neutrophils but not macrophages. Furthermore, interleukin-1β, KC, TIMP-1, and lung collagen were significantly reduced. Histologic analysis showed significantly diminished lung inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis. The therapeutic effect was dependent on treatment start and duration. Nintedanib inhibited receptor tyrosine kinase activation and the proliferation and transformation of human lung fibroblasts and showed antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in two animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Dysregulation of cellular metabolism has been shown to participate in several pathologic processes. However, the role of metabolic reprogramming is not well appreciated in the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine if glycolytic reprogramming participates in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and assess the therapeutic potential of glycolytic inhibition in treating lung fibrosis. METHODS: A cell metabolism assay was performed to determine glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration. Lactate levels were measured to assess glycolysis in fibroblasts and lungs. Glycolytic inhibition by genetic and pharmacologic approaches was used to demonstrate the critical role of glycolysis in lung fibrosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Augmentation of glycolysis is an early and sustained event during myofibroblast differentiation, which is dependent on the increased expression of critical glycolytic enzymes, in particular, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Augmented glycolysis contributes to the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, a master regulator of glycolytic enzymes implicated in organ fibrosis, by increasing cellular levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate succinate in lung myofibroblasts. Inhibition of glycolysis by the PFKFB3 inhibitor 3PO or genomic disruption of the PFKFB3 gene blunted the differentiation of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, and attenuated profibrotic phenotypes in myofibroblasts isolated from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Inhibition of glycolysis by 3PO demonstrates therapeutic benefit in bleomycin-induced and transforming growth factor-β1-induced lung fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the novel concept of glycolytic reprogramming in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and provide proof-of-concept that targeting this pathway may be efficacious in treating fibrotic disorders, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

Intracellular lactate drives a recently described type of posttranslational modification, lysine lactylation (Kla), on core histones. However, the impact of lactylation on biological processes of tumour cells remains largely unknown. Here we show a global lactylome profiling on a prospectively collected hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort. Integrative lactylome and proteome analysis of the tumours and adjacent livers identifies 9,275 Kla sites, with 9,256 sites on non-histone proteins, indicating that Kla is a prevalent modification beyond histone proteins and transcriptional regulation. Notably, Kla preferentially affects enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and carbohydrate, amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotide metabolism. We further verify that lactylation at K28 inhibits the function of adenylate kinase 2, facilitating the proliferation and metastasis of HCC cells. Our study therefore reveals that Kla plays an important role in regulating cellular metabolism and may contribute to HCC progression.},

Here, we present evidence that hexokinase 2 (HK2) is important for mediating the fibroproliferative activity of TGF-β both in vitro and in vivo. Both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGF-β signaling induced HK2 accumulation in murine and human lung fibroblasts through induction of the transcription factor c-Myc. Knockdown of HK2 or pharmacological inhibition of HK2 activity with Lonidamine decreased TGF-β-stimulated fibrogenic processes, including profibrotic gene expression, cell migration, colony formation, and activation of the transcription factors YAP and TAZ, with no apparent effect on cellular viability. Fibroblasts from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exhibited an increased abundance of HK2. In a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, Lonidamine reduced the expression of genes encoding profibrotic markers (collagenΙα1, EDA-fibronectin, α smooth muscle actin, and connective tissue growth factor) and stabilized or improved lung function as assessed by measurement of peripheral blood oxygenation. These findings provide evidence of how metabolic dysregulation through HK2 can be integrated within the context of profibrotic TGF-β signaling.},

This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases1,2. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by glycolysis, and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous 'lactate clock' in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer.},

To examine the degree to which tumors also exhibit metabolic heterogeneity at the level of individual cells, we employed multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) to quantify utilization of stable isotopes of glucose and glutamine along with a label for cell division. Mouse models of melanoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) exhibited striking heterogeneity of substrate utilization, evident in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. We identified a correlation between metabolic heterogeneity, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. Heterogeneity in metabolic substrate usage as revealed by incorporation of glucose and glutamine tracers is thus a marker for tumor proliferation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that MIMS provides a powerful tool with which to dissect metabolic functions of individual cells within the native tumor environment.},
