  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) are two quality management processes that are integral to the success of metabolomics including their application for the acquisition of high quality data in any high-throughput analytical chemistry laboratory. QA defines all the planned and systematic activities implemented before samples are collected, to provide confidence that a subsequent analytical process will fulfil predetermined requirements for quality. QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure and report these quality requirements after data acquisition. AIM OF REVIEW: This tutorial review will guide the reader through the use of system suitability and QC samples, why these samples should be applied and how the quality of data can be reported. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: System suitability samples are applied to assess the operation and lack of contamination of the analytical platform prior to sample analysis. Isotopically-labelled internal standards are applied to assess system stability for each sample analysed. Pooled QC samples are applied to condition the analytical platform, perform intra-study reproducibility measurements (QC) and to correct~mathematically for systematic errors. Standard reference materials and long-term reference QC samples are applied for inter-study and inter-laboratory assessment of data.},

  abstract = {Hypoxia requires metabolic adaptations to sustain energetically demanding cellular activities. While the metabolic consequences of hypoxia have been studied extensively in cancer cell models, comparatively little is known about how primary cell metabolism responds to hypoxia. Thus, we developed metabolic flux models for human lung fibroblast and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferating in hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we found that hypoxia decreased glycolysis despite activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and increased glycolytic enzyme expression. While HIF-1α activation in normoxia by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition did increase glycolysis, hypoxia blocked this effect. Multi-omic profiling revealed distinct molecular responses to hypoxia and PHD inhibition, and suggested a critical role for MYC in modulating HIF-1α responses to hypoxia. Consistent with this hypothesis, MYC knockdown in hypoxia increased glycolysis and MYC over-expression in normoxia decreased glycolysis stimulated by PHD inhibition. These data suggest that MYC signaling in hypoxia uncouples an increase in HIF-dependent glycolytic gene transcription from glycolytic flux.},

  abstract = {For the analysis of the spectra of complex biofluids, preprocessing methods play a crucial role in rendering the subsequent data analyses more robust and accurate. Normalization is a preprocessing method, which accounts for different dilutions of samples by scaling the spectra to the same virtual overall concentration. In the field of 1H NMR metabonomics integral normalization, which scales spectra to the same total integral, is the de facto standard. In this work, it is shown that integral normalization is a suboptimal method for normalizing spectra from metabonomic studies. Especially strong metabonomic changes, evident as massive amounts of single metabolites in samples, significantly hamper the integral normalization resulting in incorrectly scaled spectra. The probabilistic quotient normalization is introduced in this work. This method is based on the calculation of a most probable dilution factor by looking at the distribution of the quotients of the amplitudes of a test spectrum by those of a reference spectrum. Simulated spectra, spectra of urine samples from a metabonomic study with cyclosporin-A as the active compound, and spectra of more than 4000 samples of control animals demonstrate that the probabilistic quotient normalization is by far more robust and more accurate than the widespread integral normalization and vector length normalization.},

  abstract = {Metabolism of singly or multiply 13C-labeled substrates leads to the production of molecules that contain 13C atoms at various positions. Molecules differing only in the number of isotopic atoms incorporated are referred to as mass isotopomers. The distribution of mass isotopomers of many molecules can be measured by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry after chemical derivatization. Quantification of metabolite mass isotopomer abundance resulting from biological processes necessitates correction of the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the derivatized metabolite for contributions due to naturally occurring isotopes of its elements. This correction must take into account differences in the relative natural abundance distribution of each mass isotopomer (skewing). An IBM-compatible computer program was developed which (i) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of unlabeled and labeled standards given the molecular formula of the derivatized molecule or fragment ion, and (ii) calculates the natural abundance mass isotopomer distribution of the singly and multiply labeled molecule or fragment via non-linear fitting to the measured mass isotopomer distribution of the unlabeled molecule or fragment. The output of this program is used to correct measured mass isotopomer distributions for contributions from natural isotope abundances and to verify measured values for theoretical consistency. Differences between predicted and measured unlabeled and 13C-labeled isotopomer distributions for hydroxamate di-t-butyl-dimethylsilyl (di-TBDMS) derivatized pyruvate were measured. The program was applied to the mass isotopomer distribution of glucose labeled from [U-13C3]glycerol and of fatty acids labeled from [U-13C6]glucose and either [2-13C2] acetate or [U-13C2]acetate. In some of these cases, the measured mass isotopomer distributions corrected by the program were different from those corrected by the classical technique. Implications of these differences including those on the calculation of glucose production due to gluconeogenesis in isolated perfused rat liver are discussed.},

In a first-in-human study, we utilize stable isotope tracers of DNA synthesis and de novo lipogenesis to prospectively measure cell birth and adipocyte lipid turnover. In a study of healthy adults, we elucidate an age-dependent decline in new adipocyte generation and adipocyte lipid turnover. A linear regression model suggests that the aging effect could be mediated by a decline in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This study therefore establishes a method for measurement of cell turnover and metabolism in humans with subcellular resolution while implicating the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis in adipose tissue aging.},

Based on the knowledge that this procedure is not standardized in animals and results are highly variable, we hypothesized that modification of this method may improve quantification of lung fibrosis in small animals. To prove our hypothesis, we evaluated pulmonary fibrosis in Lewis rats induced by a single intratracheal injection of 0.3 mg/kg body weight bleomycin (n = 13) compared with the same amount of saline in a control group (n = 4). We modified the Ashcroft scale by precisely defining the assignment of grades from 0 to 8 for the increasing extent of fibrosis in lung histological samples. Thirty-two observers were randomly assigned to evaluate 108 photographs of slides using either the Ashcroft scale or the modified scale. Consistent with our hypothesis, there was a significant reduction in the variability of standard deviations with the modified scale compared with the Ashcroft scale (mean of variability 0.25 versus 0.62, P {$<$} 0.0001). Applying the kappa index, the Ashcroft scale showed only a fair to moderate agreement (0.23-0.59) between the observers and a low intra-observer agreement (0.51-0.74) in contrast to the modified scale, which demonstrated a moderate to good agreement between the observers (0.65-0.93, P {$<$} 0.0001) and a high intra-observer agreement (0.87-0.91, P {$<$} 0.05). To test the modified scale in vivo, we compared both scales with the results of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs obtained from the same mice. In agreement, the modified scale demonstrated a better correlation to CT scans (R = 0.58) compared with the Ashcroft scale (R = 0.33). In summary, quantification of lung fibrosis in histological lung sections using the modified scale is reliable and reproducible.},

Here we identify a key role for serine and glycine metabolism in the survival of brain cancer cells within the ischaemic zones of gliomas. In human glioblastoma multiforme, mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT2) and glycine decarboxylase (GLDC) are highly expressed in the pseudopalisading cells that surround necrotic foci. We find that SHMT2 activity limits that of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and reduces oxygen consumption, eliciting a metabolic state that confers a profound survival advantage to cells in poorly vascularized tumour regions. GLDC inhibition impairs cells with high SHMT2 levels as the excess glycine not metabolized by GLDC can be converted to the toxic molecules aminoacetone and methylglyoxal. Thus, SHMT2 is required for cancer cells to adapt to the tumour environment, but also renders these cells sensitive to glycine cleavage system inhibition.},

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. FGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).},

Mechanical ventilation (MV) maintains gas exchange in patients with ARDS but exposes lung cells to physical forces that exacerbate injury. Our data demonstrate that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a mechanosensor in lung epithelial cells and that activation of this pathway during MV impairs lung function. We found that mTORC1 is activated in lung epithelial cells following volutrauma and atelectrauma in mice and humanized in vitro models of the lung microenvironment. mTORC1 is also activated in lung tissue of mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS. Deletion of Tsc2, a negative regulator of mTORC1, in epithelial cells impairs lung compliance during MV. Conversely, treatment with rapamycin at the time MV is initiated improves lung compliance without altering lung inflammation or barrier permeability. mTORC1 inhibition mitigates physiologic lung injury by preventing surfactant dysfunction during MV. Our data demonstrate that, in contrast to canonical mTORC1 activation under favorable growth conditions, activation of mTORC1 during MV exacerbates lung injury and inhibition of this pathway may be a novel therapeutic target to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury during ARDS.},

We describe here how rates of ATP generation by each pathway can be calculated from simultaneous measurements of extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption. We update theoretical maximum ATP yields by mitochondria and cells catabolizing different substrates. Mitochondrial P/O ratios (mol of ATP generated per mol of [O] consumed) are 2.73 for oxidation of pyruvate plus malate and 1.64 for oxidation of succinate. Complete oxidation of glucose by cells yields up to 33.45 ATP/glucose with a maximum P/O of 2.79. We introduce novel indices to quantify bioenergetic phenotypes. The glycolytic index reports the proportion of ATP production from glycolysis and identifies cells as primarily glycolytic (glycolytic index {$>$} 50\%) or primarily oxidative. The Warburg effect is a chronic increase in glycolytic index, quantified by the Warburg index. Additional indices quantify the acute flexibility of ATP supply. The Crabtree index and Pasteur index quantify the responses of oxidative and glycolytic ATP production to alterations in glycolysis and oxidative reactions, respectively; the supply flexibility index quantifies overall flexibility of ATP supply; and the bioenergetic capacity quantifies the maximum rate of total ATP production. We illustrate the determination of these indices using C2C12 myoblasts. Measurement of ATP use revealed no significant preference for glycolytic or oxidative ATP by specific ATP consumers. Overall, we demonstrate how extracellular fluxes quantitatively reflect intracellular ATP turnover and cellular bioenergetics. We provide a simple spreadsheet to calculate glycolytic and oxidative ATP production rates from raw extracellular acidification and respiration data.},

L2HG accumulates in response to increases in 2-oxoglutarate, which occur as a result of tricarboxylic acid cycle dysfunction and increased mitochondrial reducing potential. These changes are closely coupled to cellular redox homeostasis, as increased cellular L2HG inhibits electron transport and glycolysis to offset the adverse consequences of mitochondrial reductive stress induced by hypoxia. Thus, L2HG couples mitochondrial and cytoplasmic energy metabolism in a model of cellular redox regulation.},

Salmon combines a new dual-phase parallel inference algorithm and feature-rich bias models with an ultra-fast read mapping procedure. It is the first transcriptome-wide quantifier to correct for fragment GC-content bias, which, as we demonstrate here, substantially improves the accuracy of abundance estimates and the sensitivity of subsequent differential expression analysis.},

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {Aberrant wound-healing responses to injury have been implicated in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, but the mediators directing these pathologic responses have yet to be fully identified. We show that lysophosphatidic acid levels increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following lung injury in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, and that mice lacking one of its receptors, LPA1, are markedly protected from fibrosis and mortality in this model. The absence of LPA1 led to reduced fibroblast recruitment and vascular leak, two responses that may be excessive when injury leads to fibrosis rather than to repair, whereas leukocyte recruitment was preserved during the first week after injury. In persons with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lysophosphatidic acid levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were also increased, and inhibition of LPA1 markedly reduced fibroblast responses to the chemotactic activity of this fluid. LPA1 therefore represents a new therapeutic target for diseases in which aberrant responses to injury contribute to fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.},

  abstract = {In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), inflammation promotes a fibroproliferative pulmonary vasculopathy. Reductionist studies emphasizing single biochemical reactions suggest a shift toward glycolytic metabolism in PAH; however, key questions remain regarding the metabolic profile of specific cell types within PAH vascular lesions in vivo. We used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) freshly isolated from an inflammatory vascular injury model of PAH ex vivo, and these data were integrated with information from human gene ontology pathways. Network medicine was then used to map all aa and glucose pathways to the consolidated human interactome, which includes data on 233,957 physical protein-protein interactions. Glucose and proline pathways were significantly close to the human PAH disease module, suggesting that these pathways are functionally relevant to PAH pathobiology. To test this observation in vivo, we used multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry to map and quantify utilization of glucose and proline in the PAH pulmonary vasculature at subcellular resolution. Our findings suggest that elevated glucose and proline avidity underlie increased biomass in PAECs and the media of fibrosed PAH pulmonary arterioles. Overall, these data show that anabolic utilization of glucose and proline are fundamental to the vascular pathology of PAH.},
