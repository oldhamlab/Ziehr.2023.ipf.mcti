# notes

- We observed no significant differences in MCT1, MCT4, or SMA expression in
  IPF-LF cultured ex vivo
- With cosmosR analysis, unable to link TF to extracellular lactate. This is
  likely related to no links in the PKN between enriched TFs and lactate
  transporters.
- IF of human IPF lung shows bright MCT1 and MCT4 expression that does not
  clearly localize with SMA staining or fibroblasts.
