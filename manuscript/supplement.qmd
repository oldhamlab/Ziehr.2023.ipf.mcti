# Figures

![**Fig. S1. Lactate transport inhibition decreases myofibroblast differentiation *in vitro*.** (**A**) Cell count following siRNA-mediated MCT knockdown. (**B**) Small molecule inhibitors of MCT1/2 (AR-C155858, AR) or MCT4 (VB124, VB) decrease TGFβ-stimulated α-SMA expression in normal human lung fibroblasts. (**C**-**D**) Cell counts following pharmacologic inhibition of lactate transporters. Summary data are mean ± SEM (\* p-value-value < 0.05; *black* compares TGFβ to control within a given treatment, *colored* compares the treatment effect to control for a given condition). ](figs/SF_01.png)

![**Fig. S2. Lactate transporter inhibition decreases pro-fibrotic gene transcription.** (**A**-**C**) Volcano plots of differentially expressed genes in TGFβ-treated cells compared to control (A), AZD3965-treated cells compared to vehicle (Veh) (B), and VB124-treated cells compared to Veh. Significantly differentially expressed genes are highlighted (adjusted p-value < 0.05), the top 15 up- and down-regulated of which are labeled.](figs/SF_02.png)

![**Fig. S3. Lactate transport inhibition alters cellular bioenergetics.** (**A**) Extracellular lactate was determined following TGFβ in the presence of MCT1/2 inhibitor AR-C155858 (AR), MCT4 inhibitor VB124 (VB), or both (N = 3-13 biological replicates, \* p-value < 0.05, *black* compares TGFβ *v.* Ctl, *colored* compares Drug *v.* Veh). (**B**) Extracellular glucose was determined following TGFβ in the presence of MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 (AZD), VB, or both (N = 5 biological replicates). (**C**) Summary data from Seahorse extracellular flux analysis. (**D**) Cell bioenergetic stress testing results from Seahorse analysis. Glycolytic capacity measures the increase in proton efflux rate following oligomycin treatment. Spare respiratory capacity measures the increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) following FCCP treatment compared to basal OCR. Coupling efficiency measures the proportion of basal OCR that contributes to ATP production (*i.e.,* the percentage inhibited by oligomycin). The spare respiratory capacity decreases following MCT inhibition, indicating a larger fraction of total respiratory capacity was utilized in the basal state in cells treated with MCT inhibitors (N = 4 biological replicates, \* p-value < 0.05 compared to TGFβ/Veh). Summary data are mean ± SEM.](figs/SF_03.png)

![**Fig. S4. Metabolomic profiling of lung fibroblasts treated with lactate transport inhibitors.** (**A**-**D**) Extracellular (A-B) and intracellular (C-D) metabolomic profile and metabolite set enrichment analyses of lung fibroblasts treated with TGFβ. (**E-H**) Extracellular (E-F) and intracellular (G-H) metabolomic profile and metabolite set enrichment analysis of AZD3965 treatment. (**I-L**) Extracellular (I-J) and intracellular (K-L) metabolomic profile and metabolite set enrichment analysis of VB124 treatment. Differentially regulated metabolites are colored (adjusted p-value < 0.1), the top 10 up- and down-regulated of which are labeled. KEGG pathways significantly enriched (adjusted p-value < 0.1) with metabolites differentially regulated by TGFβ treatment or MCT inhibition ordered by normalized enrichment score (NES). Positive NES indicates enrichment in treated cells while negative NES indicates enrichment in Vehicle-treated cells. (**M**) Labeled fraction of intracellular metabolites pyruvate (PYR), lactate (LAC), citrate (CIT), 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), succinate (SUC), and malate (MAL) following treatment with \[U-^13^C~5~\]-glutamine (N = 4 biological replicates, \* adjusted p-value < 0.05, *black* compares TGFβ *v.* Ctl for a given treatment, *colored* compares treatment *v.* vehicle for the indicated condition). Summary data are mean ± SEM.](figs/SF_04.png)

![**Fig. S5. Stable isotope tracing in lung fibroblasts treated with TGFβ.** Lung fibroblasts were cultured with stable isotopes of glucose, lactate, and glutamine during treatment with TGFβ (*columns*). Mass isotope distributions were determined by LC-MS for key metabolites in central carbon metabolic pathways (*rows*). Significant differences in isotopic enrichment are indicated (\* adjusted p-value < 0.05). Summary data are mean ± SEM (N = 4 biological replicates).](figs/SF_05.png)

![**Fig. S6. Lactate transport inhibition activates antioxidant defenses.** (**A**) The cellular redox couple NADPH/NADP^+^ was determined by enzymatic cycling assay (N = 4 biological replicates; \* adjusted p-value < 0.05; *black* compares TGFβ to control within a given treatment, *colored* compares the treatment effect to control for a given condition). (**B**) MitoTracker fluorescence was measured as a marker of mitochondrial mass (N = 3 biological replicates; \* adjusted p-value < 0.05 compared to TGFβ-treated cells).

(**B**) Lactate transport inhibition does not attenuate HIF-1α stabilization 6 h after TGFβ treatment. Summary data are mean ± SEM. (N = 4 biological replicates, \* adjusted p-value < 0.05, *black* compares TGFβ *v.* Ctl for a given treatment, *colored* compares treatment *v.* vehicle for the indicated condition).](figs/SF_07.png)

![**Fig. S8. Lactate transport inhibition improves weight gain following bleomycin.** Following bleomycin, mice were weighed weekly. Data points show individual mice, summary statistics show the mean ± SEM, \* adjusted p-value-value < 0.05 for the overall treatment effect compared to bleomycin-treated (Bleo) vehicle control.](figs/SF_08.png)
